# Market-Fit-Analysis-For-Air-Purifier-Product-Launch
Conducted market fit research for a consumer appliance startup using real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data and secondary sources to identify high-potential launch markets, product features, and R&amp;D focus areas.
# 🌍 Market Fit Analysis for Air Purifier Product Launch

## 📌 Overview
This project conducts a **data-driven market fit analysis** for *AirPure Innovations*, a startup addressing India’s severe air quality crisis — with **14 cities among the world’s top 20 most polluted**.  

The goal: identify **high-demand geographies**, **essential product features**, and **R&D priorities** using AQI and related datasets, enabling informed go-to-market decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Before committing to production and R&D, *AirPure Innovations* needed to answer:
1. **Pollutants to Target:** Which pollutants/particles should the air purifier focus on?  
2. **Feature Prioritization:** What features are essential for the target market?  
3. **Market Identification:** Which cities have the highest potential demand?  
4. **R&D Alignment:** How should product development align with localized pollution patterns?  

📍 Rising consumer awareness examples:
- Delhi hotels display AQI readings to guests.
- Public figures leaving events due to poor air quality.

---

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset:**  
  - AQI data (2022–2025) from *Dataful* platform.
- **Secondary Datasets:**  
  - Health impact data (diseases, mortality rates)  
  - Vehicle registration data  
  - Population demographics
- **External Sources:**  
  - WHO health reports  
  - Government pollution board reports  
  - News coverage on pollution events

---

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Extracted AQI readings, health stats, and vehicle data; standardized pollutant units; removed nulls/duplicates.  
2. **EDA** – Identified top pollutants, mapped seasonal trends, visualized long-term AQI patterns.  
3. **Severity Mapping** – Ranked cities by persistent/worsening AQI levels.  
4. **Health Impact Correlation** – Linked pollutant levels to disease prevalence.  
5. **Demand Trigger Analysis** – Studied consumer interest during pollution spikes (e.g., post-Diwali).  
6. **Feature Gap Mapping** – Benchmarked competitor products vs. unmet market needs.  
7. **Visualization** – Developed **interactive Power BI dashboard** for:
   - Market opportunity ranking  
   - Pollution-health impact links  
   - Feature prioritization matrix

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Top 10 cities** scored **>82/100** on the opportunity index (Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad leading).  
- **PM2.5** and **PM10** are the most critical pollutants to target.  
- Seasonal demand spikes in **Oct–Dec** due to winter smog & post-festival pollution.  
- Northern metros have higher health burden correlation due to dense population & vehicle emissions.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Target **Delhi NCR, Lucknow, Kanpur** for initial launch.  
- Include **HEPA 13 filters**, **activated carbon filtration**, and **IoT AQI monitoring** for premium segment.  
- Focus R&D on **PM2.5 removal efficiency** and **low-maintenance design**.  
- Launch **seasonal marketing campaigns** during high-pollution months.
